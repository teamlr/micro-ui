# Micro UI

Small in size but great in action micro UI library
* Run frameworks (e.g Angular, React, Vue) in one application easily
* Divide your framework monolith into smaller, independent and technology-agnostic parts
* Release your changes in an application without rebuilding and redeployment the entire application

## Try it in action 

Install all dependencies for the library project
```bash
npm install
```

Install dependencies for micro-ui example
```bash
npx lerna bootstrap
```

Build example microapps
```bash
npm run build:microapp
```

Serve example microapps
```bash
npm run serve:microapp
```

Serve  micro-ui shell
```bash
npm run serve:shell
```

```bash
Go to http://localhost:9000/
```

### Description and plans for the future

The library design is in early development, but the most important features are working properly. The library uses WebComponents as a micro-ui interface, thanks to which the micro-application shell is able to run micro-applications written in either Angular or React or pure WC.

A big advantage is the fact that the location of the sources and their configuration are provided in runtime. This allows for release of individual functionality in micro-applications without rebuilding and redeployment entire application.
